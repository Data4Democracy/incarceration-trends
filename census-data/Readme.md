# Census Data 

This directory is for census data, preferably by county with 5-digit FIPS code to be easily joined to the VERA data

## Files
1. _censusSAIPEByCountyAndYear.csv_ : This file contains the SAIPE (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe.html) data, pulled by county for all the years included in the data (1989, 1993, 1995, 1997-2017).  I've included median household income, the margin of error for median household income, and the poverty rate.  The SAIPE data also has poverty breakdowns by age group and I could add those if it's of interest.
