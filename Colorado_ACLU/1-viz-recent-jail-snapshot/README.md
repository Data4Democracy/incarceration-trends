We met to discus the first steps for task 1 for the Colorado ACLU collaboartion.

*Meeting Takeaways*
- ASAP: Garrett will clean up the ACLU `xlsx` as best as possible.
- With these files in hand the team will develop a set of issues/questions that can be raised with our ACLU contacts, epsecially in the case where clarification is needed for progress.
- The team will start to investigate the data and develop ideas for possible analysis and visualization.
- A meeting will be set up for next week (Jan. 14-18) to discuss what was found in the initial analysis and (hopefully) the feedback from our questions from the ACLU 

*Goals*
- Get questions out to the ACLU asap
