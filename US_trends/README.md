**This is a stub for a more fleshed out README**

The focus of this sub-project is general incarceration trends in the US


Some preliminary thoughts on definitions and terminology. Please add to and discuss.

**Using Vera Columns**

*Crime Rate*   
Definition: IndexCrime/TotalPop   
Questions: Should this use TotalPop or TotalPop15to64 as denominator?

*Incarceration Rate*   
Definition: TotalPrisonPop/TotalPop  
Questions: Should this use TotalPop or TotalPop15to64 as denominator?  I can make more of a case for 15to64 here but it might make sense for this and crime rate to be consistent?  Should the numerator here include jail?

*Imprisoned Per Crime* 
Definition: TotalPrisonAdm/IndexCrime  
Questions: I'm not sure if this (or a near variant) has a name already.  I think it might be interesting as a way to look at how many people are being imprisoned at a given level of (reported) crime.  I also think it's a very imperfect way to look at this since some of the same things that lead to high rates of incarceration also lead to higher crime rates, e.g., stop & frisk. And should this numerator include jail?
